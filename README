3. Note

3.1 Some field of the table should be changed. For example,in albums table the property of album field is 'not null'.  And the 'album_key' is unique. It's also exist in other tables. Maybe you have found this when you insert data manually. Actually some times  the album is null. So I give an advice that it should not add 'not null' property for album field.

3.2 The application can not insert data into database when it's in application bundle. So we should copy the database to application directory first when we want to insert data into database.
